When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When the project is been worked on by multiple people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    In order to keep a track of the file and be aware if any changes are made

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Fork is used to colne directly to GitHub. Clone is used to clone from github to local. Brances are side chains where we experiment with features etc. 


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Easy access and also lets you keep a track of your project.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Manually and working togather and inform about every change manually.
    
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

  When an experimental feature is worked on and we do not want our working master to go crazy.
